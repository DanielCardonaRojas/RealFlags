# IndomioFlags

IndomioFlags makes it **easy to configure feature flags** in your codebase.  
It's designed for Swift and **provides a simple and elegant abstraction layer** over multiple providers you can query with your own priority.  
It also comes with an **handy UI tool to browse and alter values directly at runtime!**

## üé∏ Features Highlights

- **Simple & Elegant**: Effectively describe and organize your own flags with a type-safe structure. It will abstract your implementation and consistently reduce the amount of code to manage your feature flags
- **Extensible**: You can use one of the default data providers or create your own. We support Firebase Remote and Local configurations too
- **Complete**: Feature Flags supports all primitive datatypes and complex objects: `Int` (and any numeric variant), `String`, `Bool`, `Data`, `Date`, `URL`, `Dictionary`, `Array` (values must conform to `FlagProtocol`), Optional Values and virtually any object conforms to `Codable` protocol!
- **Configurable**: Enable, disable and customize features at runtime
- **Integrated UI Tool**: the handy UI Tool allows you to customize and read flags at glance

## ü§ü What You Get

Our goal making IndomioFlags is to provide a type-safe abstract way to describe and query for feature flags.

The first step is to  describe your collection of flags:

```swift
// Define the structure of your feature flags with type-safe properties!
struct UserFlags: FlagCollectionProtocol {
    @Flag(default: true, description: "Show social login options along native login form")
    var showSocialLogin: Bool
    
    @Flag(default: 0, description: "Maximum login attempts before blocking account")
    var maxLoginAttempts: Int
    
    @Flag(key: "rating_mode", default: "at_launch", description: "The behaviour to show the rating popup")
    var appReviewRating: String
}
```

This represent a type-safe description of some flags grouped in a collection. 
Each feature flags property is identified by the `@Flag` annotation. 
It's time load values for this collection; using a new `FlagsLoader` you will be able to load and query collection's values from one or more data provider:

```swift
// Allocate your own data providers
let localProvider = LocalProvider(localURL: fileURL)
let fbProvider = FirebaseRemoteProvider()

// Loader is the point for query values
let userFlagsLoader = FlagsLoader(UserFlags.self, // load flags definition
                                  providers: [fbProvider, localProvider]) // set providers
```

Now you can query values from `userFlagsLoader` by using the `UserFlags` structure (it suppports autocomplete and type-safe value thanks to `@dynamicMemberLookup`!).  
Let me show it:

```swift
if userFlagsLoader.showSocialLogin { // query properties as type-safe with autocomplete!
    // do some stuff
}
```

Values are obtained respecting the order you have specified, in this case from Firebase Remote Config service then, when no value is found, into the local repository.  
If no values are available the default value specified in `@Flags` annotation is returned.

This is just an overview of the library; if you want to know more follow the [documentation below](#documentation).

## üéõ Flags Browser & Editor

IndomioFlags also comes with an handy tool you can use to browse and edit feature flags values directly in your client! It can be useful for testing purpose or allow product owners to enable/disable and verify features of the app.

    .package(url: "", from: "1.0.0")
]
```

And add it as a dependency of your target:

```swift
targets: [
    .target(name: "MyTarget", dependencies: [
        .product(name: "", package: "")
    ])
]
```

In Xcode 11+ you can also navigate to the File menu and choose Swift Packages -> Add Package Dependency..., then enter the repository URL and version details.

### CocoaPods
